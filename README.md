# SpellHumana

SpellHumana is an interactive tool that combines spell-checking, AI text detection, and humanization of machine-generated content. It helps identify if a piece of text is written by a human or a machine, and if it's machine-generated, it can convert the text into a more human-like format.

This project leverages advanced language models from Hugging Face and SpellChecker for spelling corrections.

# Features
Spell Checking: Automatically detects and corrects spelling errors in the text.

AI vs Human Detection: Identifies whether the given text was written by a human or generated by a machine.

Humanization: Converts machine-generated text into more human-like text using AI models.

Interactive UI: A simple web-based UI created with Google Colab and ipywidgets, where you can paste your text, submit it, and get results instantly.

# Installation
Install the required dependencies:
```
!pip install transformers
!pip install torch
!pip install pyspellchecker
!pip install ipywidgets
```
# How to Use
* Enter your text: Paste or type your text into the input box.

* Submit the text: Click the "Process Text" button.

### Results:

* The corrected text (with spelling fixes) will be displayed.

* The system will detect if the text is human-written or machine-generated.

* If the text is detected as machine-generated, it will be humanized to make it more natural and readable.
